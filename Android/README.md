# Kinder
Kinder is an application product as the main solution for dragon fruit farmers in Banyuwangi, who have a habit of throwing away their harvest if the price is too cheap at the collectors. As an effort to change this habit, we provide a level gamification feature for both actors to compete with each other to donate and also help farmers by buying their cheap crops.
